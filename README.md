In this repository I collect tutorials and examples of the tools that I use
in computer networks and operating systems.
They are essential command lines that every ```network engineer```, ```devops engineer```, and ```sysops engineer```
should be familiar with.
These tools consists of network monitoring, network administration, network configuration,
operating system management, and operating system configuration command line applications.
