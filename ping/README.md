# ping

```ping``` (Packet Internet or Inter-Network Groper) is a basic
internet program that allows a user to test and verify if a particular destination
IP address exists and can accept requests in computer network administration.

```ping``` works by sending an ```Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)```
Echo Request to a specified interface on the network and waiting for a reply.
When a ```ping``` command is issued, a ```ping``` signal is sent to a specified address.
When the target host receives the echo request, it responds by sending an echo reply packet.
