# nslookup

Name server lookup (```nslookup```) is a command-line tool that lets you find the internet protocol (IP)
address or domain name system (DNS) record of a specific hostname.
This command also allows reverse DNS lookup by inputting the IP addresses of the corresponding domains.

The ```nslookup``` tool is useful for DNS-related tasks, such as server testing or troubleshooting issues.
