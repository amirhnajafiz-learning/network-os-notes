# ifconfig

```ifconfig``` stands for Interface Configuration.
The ```ifconfig``` function displays the current configuration for a ```network interface```
when no optional parameters are supplied. If a protocol family is specified,
```ifconfig``` reports only the details specific to that protocol family.

```ifconfig``` is used to configure, or view the configuration of, a network interface.

Note:

> On modern Linux systems, the ```ip``` command has replaced ```ifconfig``` command.

## Commands

```sh
ifconfig -a
```
